Master's Work
=============

Three Dimensional Teleoperation with the Microsoft Kinect

Goals:

* Develop 3D and photo-realistic teleoperation capabilities at Auburn
* Learn about the robotic perception field
* Try and reproduce previous work with the lost cost Kinect sensor

ION Paper
=========

Elements:

* Show the Kinect in teleoperation activities
* Show how octrees can help reduce bandwidth
* 

---

Master's Thesis
===============

In addition to ION Paper:

* Improve resilience to latency with vehicle model
* Take color image data and apply to octree visualization
