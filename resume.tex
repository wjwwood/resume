%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Document Setup %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Don't like 10pt? Try 11pt or 12pt
\documentclass[10pt]{article}

% This is a helpful package that puts math inside length specifications
\usepackage{calc}

% Layout: Puts the section titles on left side of page
\reversemarginpar

%
%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.
%

%% Use these lines for letter-sized paper
\usepackage[paper=letterpaper,
            %includefoot, % Uncomment to put page number above margin

            margin=1in,               % 1 inch margins
            includemp]{geometry}

%            margin=25mm,              % 25mm margins
%            includemp]{geometry}

%% More layout: Get rid of indenting throughout entire document
\setlength{\parindent}{0in}

%% This gives us fun enumeration environments. compactitem will be nice.
\usepackage{paralist}

%% Reference the last page in the page number
%
% NOTE: comment the +LP line and uncomment the -LP line to have page
%       numbers without the ``of ##'' last page reference)
%
% NOTE: uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} line to get rid of all page
%       numbers (make sure includefoot is commented out above)
%
\usepackage{fancyhdr,lastpage}
\pagestyle{fancy}
%\pagestyle{empty}      % Uncomment this to get rid of page numbers
\fancyhf{}\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt}

%
% Place at top of document. It should be the first thing.

% The section headings
%
% Usage: \section{section name}
%
% Follow this section IMMEDIATELY with the first line of the section
% text. Do not put whitespace in between. That is, do this:

%
% and NOT this:
%
%       \section{My Information}
%
%       Here is my information.
%
% Otherwise the top of the section header will not line up with the top
% of the section. Of course, using a single comment character (%) on
